# 👋 Hi, I'm Damian Kłos

**Frontend Developer** • **React Enthusiast** • **Next.js Power User**

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where the components are reusable, the code is clean (mostly), and performance is a top priority.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- ⚛️ Building modern UIs with **React** and **Next.js**
- 🧪 Writing fast, reliable tests with **Vitest**
- 🧩 Structuring monorepos with **Turborepo**
- ⚡ Using **pnpm** to install dependencies at the speed of light
- 🎯 Focused on performance, DX, and accessibility

## 🧠 Current Interests

- Exploring the bleeding edge of frontend tooling
- Optimizing apps for speed, scale, and sanity
- Sharing knowledge through code and collaboration


## 🧩 Fun Facts

- Yes, I *do* have strong opinions about folder structure.
- I break staging so you don’t have to.
- “Just one last tweak” has never been true.
